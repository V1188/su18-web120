<h3>Responsively Designed Websites</h3>

<p>Responsive website and mobile application - It may seem like there isn’t a big difference between the two, but when we dive a little deeper into the topic, we are talking about two very important, connected and still slightly different things.</p>

<p>Responsively designed websites ensure that the content is rendered in a proper manner no matter what device is used - i.e; it is able to self adapt to any device automatically. (This is not to be confused with adaptive web design which has pre-set sizes). Responsive websites require less time, effort and money in that the built website usually works on various mobile platforms. Another edge that a website has over app is that it is easy to maintain, update and fix bugs. But it also has several disadvantages - it requires internet connection since it pulls information directly from the browser, poor performance on mobile devices since images etc take time and consume a lot of battery to load, uneven look and feel across different platforms like iOS/android etc.</p> 
 
<p>As we live in a world with progressively increasing number of mobile users, it has almost become essential to have a native app to complement the responsive website viewing in order to provide a good overall experience.</p>

<p>“Responsively-designed websites only partially address the needs of the mobile users,” said Andrew Yu, founder and CTO of Modo Labs, Inc. “A great mobile user experience is essentially about shortening the distance to the goal.”
</p>

<h3>Native/Mobile Applications</h3>

<p>Native apps take the mobile experience to the next level by presenting the content, functionality and navigation in a way that is optimized to easily access at the spur of the moment. It has an added advantage of being able to engage the users in an efficient and effective manner with push notifications. Apps have increased security over websites since no third party tracking is present. Also, native apps have better performance with respect to loading times - i.e they are much faster. The best of all, native apps are easily accessible without having to go through the hassle of opening the mobile navigation, entering the domain name and waiting for the page to load each time the user needs to connect.</p>

<p>So, ideally while complementing a responsive website with a native app for any business, it is imperative not to turn the app into a clone of the website. Instead, essential features and functions that reflect the main idea of the website should be picked and developed.</p>


<p>“The differences between Responsive and Native would be like differences between a car and a motorcycle. There is no one better than the other, it is just a matter of taste and needs."
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>What you choose for your business depends on your requirements and budget. If the site intends to be just informational and if you have a small budget, responsive website works just fine. But if your business tends to be more transaction-based and looks for unser engaging experience - it is highly beneficial to consider a mobile app even if at a higher cost to market.
